\chapter{Implementation}


Building upon the methodology outlined in the previous section, the implementation phase of this thesis serves as the practical manifestation of our research objectives. Here, we explore the practical implementation of text document classification algorithms, combining machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) approaches to improve the precision and effectiveness of classifying textual documents.

This section provides a thorough overview of the pipeline (figure XX), outlining the procedures for preprocessing data, extracting features, model selection and training, and assessing performance. Through the conversion of theoretical ideas into practical procedures, our goal is to offer a thorough grasp of how these methods are applied in real-life situations.
